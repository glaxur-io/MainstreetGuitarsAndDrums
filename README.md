Main Street Guitar and Drums
Made By Isaiah Santillan(@glaxur)

This is my first paid web application that was given to me to do after
I graduated boot camp.

It allows the owners of the shop and site to upload equipment and 
instruments using django admin.

Tools and languages used:
* Django
* REST
* HTML
* CSS
* dj-database-url
* AWS S3 Buckets
* Bootstrap
* Heroku
* postgres

...and a lot of google searches
